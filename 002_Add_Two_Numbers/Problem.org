#+TITLE: 2. Add Two Numbers

Rank ~Medium~

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.
The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single
digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.


You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the
number 0 itself.


* Example:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
#+END_QUOTE

* Solution:
This problem is relatively simply if you are familiar with the basic data
structure linked list.

Just need to visit two linked list, have them sum up, in the meantime, need to
care about whether one of the linked list is empty, and whether the sum in each
time is bigger than 9.
